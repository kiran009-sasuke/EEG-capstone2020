# Project 6/7 Code Repository

## Arduino and Python

Right now, there are two sets of code: arduino and python.
the arduino folder will hold all the sketches need to program the arduino. These must be uploaded to the arduino with the arduino IDE.
*note* Using the arduino NANO. Serial port is /dev/ttyUSB0
the python folder will hold all the computer side code. This will hold the GUI and other tests.

## Project Description

To develop code to interface our headset prototype to a computer. Includes developing a GUI and potentially a game.
This repository will hold all the code used for our project.
