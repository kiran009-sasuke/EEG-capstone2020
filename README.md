# Project 6/7 Code Repository

## Arduino and Python

Right now, there are two sets of code: arduino and python.
the arduino folder will hold all the sketches need to program the arduino. These must be uploaded to the arduino with the arduino IDE.
*note* Using the arduino NANO. Serial port is /dev/ttyUSB0
the python folder will hold all the computer side code. This will hold the GUI and other tests.

## Project Description

To develop code to interface our headset prototype to a computer. Includes developing a GUI and potentially a game.
This repository will hold all the code used for our project.

## Instructions

Download both files, open the arduinoEEG in Arduino IDE. Upload the sketch to your assembled arduino.

Next, download and install python 2 or 3 (https://www.python.org/) and open a console window.
Install the required libraries:

> python pip install pyqt5 pyqtgraph serial numpy

then run the code:

> python python/gui.py
